##### In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?

A VPS is a vrtual machine sold as a service by an internet hosting service.
With VPS hosting, you don't need to use an entire service. You are using a small portion of a hard drive that is dedicated to your files. It is separate from the rest of the hard drive of the machine on which it is hosted, which means it more cost-efficient and potentially, more secure.

##### Optional bonus question: Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?

If something goes wrong with the program, and you are not running it as root, it will affect your system less than if you are running as root. Running the program as root has the potential of damaging your system.

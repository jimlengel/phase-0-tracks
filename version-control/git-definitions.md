# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version control is tracking changes in a file or files, specifically in source code, over time. It is useful because it allows the user to compare changes that have been made over time. You can go forward or backward in time. So if there is a bug, you can look at when the bug appeared and go back to that point in time and see what was changed.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

A branch is a place that is created that allows the user to try new ideas on code that does not affect the master branch. It allows features to be built that don't affect the master branch, but can be added back to the master branch if the features are decided to be working and are desirable.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit is created so that Git can track the change. A commit will put the file(s) into the repository on Git. First you make a change, then you add the change, them you commit.

A good commit message describes the changes that you are making, in the present tense. For example, "Fix type in title of page"

* What is a merge conflict?

This is when the same line of code has two changes from two different commits. Git does not have the ability to decide which of the two changes is preffered and this is a conflict that must be resolved.
